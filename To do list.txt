1. Figure out how FileManager and TextureBank should work. 
	a. Fixed. TextureBank is really good. Possible improvements could be in FileManager - Since Texturebank's only use of filemanager is 
	to get the file name of a texture to load, does file manager need all the methods it has to get files with or without extensions? 
	Can't I get exactly what I need? I guess it's good to have, since FileManager could be used for other things, not just texture
	loading. 

	b. TextureBank's AddTexture method calls new texture, and then the Cleanup method calls delete. Is there a way to make this 
	a smart pointer? 

	c. TextureBank has an init() method. Can this be put into the constructor? Pass in the renderer and other things it needs?

I. Fixed. Rewrite those FileManger methods using filesystem. 
	Contructor of Directory_iterator in FileManager::get_files_in_folders can throw error. How to handle this?
		Handled it with std::error. Bookmarked on google chrome how to do it. 
		
		Some Filemanager methods were writter using boost and split.

1. Wrote Most if not all Filemanager methods I think.
2. Tomorrow work on TextureBank and also look into init() or constructor as mentioned above.
